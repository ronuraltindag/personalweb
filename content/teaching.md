[Stephen D. O'Connell](https://www.stephenoconnell.org/) (Emory University) and I are working on a joint project to integrate R into the undergraduate econometrics courses offered at both universities. The aim is to develop an applied and data-oriented course which will contain all learning material hosted online, while spending the classroom time on hands-on learning. The project is in development and we are aiming to finish a beta version by Spring 2019.
